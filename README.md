# DittoSandbox
Sandbox for Umbraco and Ditto, including custom processors and demo property converters. This is my personal compilation of code from various sources listed below, with tweaks that I use for building Umbraco websites.  

This sandbox allows me to demo the ease of use for Ditto and is a repository of great code to re-use!

Some sources: 

**Umbraco**: https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS

**Ditto**: https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-ditto

**Dittoified**: https://github.com/lars-erik/DittoDemoModelsBuilderified/tree/master/Dittoified
- A lot of the processors from this demo are in my DittoSandbox and I've attempted to extend for demo purposes. 

**Umbraco Core Property Value Converters**: https://github.com/Jeavon/Umbraco-Core-Property-Value-Converters/
- I extract the RelatedLinks code into the sandbox to demo the functionality.
